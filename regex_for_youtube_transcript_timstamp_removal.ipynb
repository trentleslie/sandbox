      "preliminary lenses and that would be the literature review and conversation with theorists and and the research that is\n",

      "what did we find in the data and then revising that and going back into cycle\n",
      "two again and continuing to refine that process until we get our results and\n",
      "final implications so the first cycle again is that topic\n",
      "development and that begins with this intuitive process so within intuitive inquiry it\n",
      "is it's profound in a way that it incorporates the heart and in the mind\n",
      "and it does so in a way that that prescribes intuition at the Forefront of\n",
      "this development so these are just different ways that the intuition is\n",
      "present throughout the entirety of the research and through that intuition there is a I\n",
      "came across this this piece that was sticky for me and and we\n",
      "hear of the the dark feminine which is this idea of going into the Shadow and\n",
      "being able to heal what what has been put into the\n",

      "kind of this negative thing and when we consider people of color and how for\n",

      "let's go and combine those with perverse of anything that is away from the norm\n",
      "or what is good or traditional and feminine and when we combine that not\n",

      "how the feminine has been perverted but the perverse feminine which is how those\n",
      "things are incorporated or internalized in the psyche\n",
      "and working with those two concepts we can start to see how this idea of\n",
      "feminine if we think of an archetype is\n",
      "coming forth through a projection or an archetypal image so\n",
      "a great example of the archetype in the archetypal image is the mother collectively we can have an idea of what\n",

      "building on Jung's framework here to address the cycle of sexism which is\n",
      "this idea of you have the overt sexism which we see in media objectification commodification we see the rape culture\n",
      "violence against women sex trafficking Etc and then how those how the messages that\n",
      "are integrated or imbued into that sexism\n",
      "are internalized and we can call that internalized sexism or covert sexism and\n",
      "this is a process of where the oppression the overall oppression is uh\n",
      "is internalized so the those who are oppressed become their own oppressor\n",
      "so that can be internal dialogue or behaviors or ways that for me for\n",
      "instance if I say I am liberated sexually or I believe in supporting\n",
      "other women in their sexual freedom and then I judge a woman for expressing\n",
      "yourself sexually then that is this this push and pull of that internalized\n",
      "sexism so for me personally I've chosen the\n",
      "archetypal image of Lilith to understand and and integrate the\n",

      "am a Jewish woman and I am interested in going into my ancestry and understanding how I can place Judaism through this\n",
      "feminist lens so it was exciting for me to understand this mythological presence\n",
      "of Lilith and then the most important part though is that Lilith as a myth has been\n",
      "present since Babylonian times and and she continues\n",
      "to be this presence in in society and not only\n",
      "through throughout history but also specifically in this context we're looking at the Jewish myth uh presented\n",
      "in the alphabet of benzira around 700 uh Common Era and\n",
      "there are so many ways that the myth encapsulates how sexism has been present\n",
      "and how it can be internalized uh the story very very uh in a very short\n",
      "summary is that Lilith was the first wife of Adam who asserted herself\n",
      "sexually and because she did this and she said no\n",
      "she was banned from the Garden of Eden demonized and she became this she demon\n",
      "from Fatal which sorcerer sorceress uh succubus whose intent was to steal the\n",
      "sperm of men and create her her demon babies so she can wreak havoc and just\n",
      "be evil so she has has represented this idea of the woman who is autonomous the\n",
      "woman who says no as evil as wrong as distorted as demonized and as perverse\n",
      "and not only does this myth allow for that container to occur but it also is\n",
      "present in the feminist world as a symbol of that empowerment and that\n",
      "autonomy so I engage with the Lilith myth as a way or a framework or container to hold\n",
      "the historical uh backing of sexism through through various fields which\n",
      "that brings us to cycle two the literature review and I just want to\n",
      "to mention what emerged out of the literature review which which is that\n",
      "dialogue with the community or with current theorists of we have different brackets of how Lilith is really\n",
      "engaging all of them we have feminist spirituality which we're the goddess movement dark feminine uh the Witchcraft\n",
      "different ways to hold religion we have Lilith herself which is not only been a\n",
      "mythological interest in in the religious sense but also in psychological a psychological theory so\n",
      "there have already been many scholars who have engaged with Lilith in in the frame of yum through the shadow and\n",
      "through this archetype and then feminism I engaged with a lot of post-modern\n",
      "feminists uh who can give me that frame of how gender is potentially distorted\n",
      "and questions of uh the woman and what is the woman and how how can this be engaged in today's\n",
      "uh contemporary Society then we have the archetypal and the post-feminist jungian\n",
      "uh theorists the methodology of both intuitive inquiry and later narrative\n",
      "and then psychology we're holding that space of the internalized oppression\n",
      "so as I engage with that with that cycle too I started to\n",
      "understand how the different buckets that Lilith represented with this idea\n",
      "of perverting the feminine so how the feminine has been perverted and it starts through that natural system of\n",
      "the patriarchy and then engaging with sexism so how those two play together\n",
      "and then they emerge through these different fields of religion uh where we\n",
      "get the witch hunts we get uh the witch craze we get the idea that women are crazy and evil through religion and that\n",
      "moves into the media not only in today's media consumption of television and film\n",
      "and magazines and social media but in myth and in story and in how that\n",
      "Distortion has occurred specifically in the western lens and then psychology feeds into that religion of what I just\n",
      "mentioned of women are crazy women are evil and and that's when this idea of\n",
      "the wandering womb which is taking the physical body and and creating this idea of Hysteria or the woman because of her\n",
      "body and because of her womb she is quote unquote crazy and then later in\n",
      "hysteria actually was in the DSM until around 1983 which then interestingly\n",
      "enough borderline personality disorder started to emerge at that same time and\n",
      "there are different feminists who speculate that this is a response of the\n",
      "the sexist reality the oppressed reality I'm sure not all the time but this is a\n",
      "theory and then we see in business and politics where where the the women are\n",
      "women are stupid there's throughout the the participant interviews there was a lot of uh insight\n",
      "into how they felt that they they were just weak as Leaders not not even from\n",
      "an internal way but because that societal pressure or that external idea\n",
      "of weakness really was was holding them back from being able to be leaders and\n",
      "we get this this idea of let's say women are we have the Hillary Clinton campaign and how Hillary Clinton was\n",
      "seen as both a witch and also very very much categorized as this this harsh\n",
      "aggressive why can't she be more traditionally feminine I I had friends\n",
      "who identify as women who who would make comments like that and then we have Sarah Palin of this idea of okay here is\n",
      "the quote-unquote hyper masculine traditional feminine and and it's the same it's it's a\n",
      "it's there's no no slack there there is still this idea of okay she is hyper\n",
      "feminine and she is stupid and she is weak so where does this dichotomy lead us where does this Distortion of the\n",
      "feminine create a an internal\n",
      "psychic distortion and that is when I start to really\n",
      "understand okay the perverse feminine is this oppositional idea from the\n",
      "traditional or the divine feminine and and that was\n",
      "that was corroborated throughout the interviews as well and here is this this fragmentation or this binary pull of I\n",
      "can either be logical or I can be emotional I cannot be both at the same\n",
      "time and I just want to speak about uh Judith\n",
      "Butler for a moment and gender performativity in in all of this information is really built off of her\n",
      "theory of of gender performativity which is this\n",
      "idea that if I want to be a fill in the blank a man then I have to be masculine\n",
      "and being masculine means that I I go by these different rules of what\n",
      "masculinity can and can't be so so that is the mask that is worn or\n",
      "that is the way this this hypothetical game is played\n",
      "so when we get to cycle three this is the info the the the starting the juice\n",
      "of it so this is that return Arc of the intuitive inquiry where I can begin to\n",
      "interview the participants so simply put convenience and snowball sampling is\n",
      "just being able to find online forms go to my school friends and then the\n",
      "Snowball Effect is them helping by bringing in their people people that\n",
      "they know for participants for the participants so I interviewed 15 cisgender women age 30 and over I\n",
      "included the cisgender peace not only because my personal experience but because of the specific\n",
      "internalization of those gender Norms that are very young age uh and then for\n",
      "me I chose women who I I felt represented the perverse so those who\n",
      "live on somewhat of a fringe or an alternative way of life and then I was\n",
      "interested in a diverse range of opinions so I found those who both\n",
      "identify as Summoners and anti-feminists as well limitations and deal limitations I won't\n",
      "go too deeply into this because we're we're flying by here but the the biggest\n",
      "limitation that is present in this research is race and I did not purposely\n",
      "only recruit a certain color but the interesting thing was the oh the main\n",
      "population who came to me were white women and and I found that interesting\n",
      "because women of color are situated at this intersection of Oppression not only\n",
      "of racism but also sexism and how can they have the privilege to even\n",
      "speculate about internalized sexism and and there needs to be more work in that\n",
      "space uh so so that was a a large limitation here\n",
      "interview protocol they just it was on video conferencing focused on feminist\n",
      "phenomenology and those interview questions were really fluid in\n",
      "nature so I had the semi-structured where it would it would flow with each participant based on their story and\n",
      "this was the analysis timeline the most relevant or important information here\n",
      "was that I went through thematic analysis over and over and over and I\n",
      "came to a point of understanding that oh wait a second these things not only are they not separate but they are telling a\n",
      "story so what is the Arc of the story and and what is what is being said here so\n",
      "that's when I finally got to this point of Storytelling which allowed me to break open a framework\n",
      "and that brings us to the results so through the results I'm going to introduce the participants we're going\n",
      "to go through the framework overview and then the question again of what is the perverse feminine archetype\n",
      "begins not only from my perspective but now it's from the participant perspective\n",
      "so I'm not going to read every single quote here and I just want to introduce\n",
      "you to the participants I'm using the pseudonym and uh we're just saying okay\n",
      "here's here's one quote you burn me at the stake I come next slide I reincarnate and I'm here again try it\n",
      "again burn me again let's see what happened I'm still here and\n",
      "and these types of these these quotes magnify the influence of this topic not\n",
      "only on that participant's life in the day-to-day but throughout the interview uh so I wish we had time to go through\n",
      "each and every one of these quotes but we will pick out another one\n",
      "so the idea of power and subservateness was my identity so so understanding that\n",
      "that internalization has become an identity that has become a\n",
      "distorted identity of what someone can or can't be\n",
      "so now we get to the framework and the framework is one that builds on each\n",
      "other so each of these stages not only are intertwined we see bits and\n",
      "pieces in each of them but they also build so we have this stage of\n",
      "indoctrination which happens in early upbringing those are the external messages\n",
      "stage two is the shape shifting so the way that there there's this coping\n",
      "mechanism that occurs that participants may have believed that they\n",
      "were putting on a show or creating a mask but really that became them or\n",
      "their who they believe themselves to be and then we get to the awareness not\n",
      "only in the interviews of epiphanies and and different uh different ideas that came up that are\n",
      "very exciting and we'll go through but that that awareness started to shift and started to say okay how do I redefine\n",
      "this idea of a woman for myself so the first one is stage stage one\n",
      "indoctrination and through this we have different sub themes ingrained feminine expectations which is this expectation\n",
      "of traditional femininity dehumanization where there's an\n",
      "objectification a commodification of the body and a shame of the body and even an\n",
      "unnatural sense of I hate having my period I think it makes me weak those\n",
      "types of responses throughout interviews and then codependency fostering this\n",
      "this idea that I have to have a partner there were several stories of in\n",
      "childhood being taught that it's great to have a man's sexual attention even\n",
      "even though I'm eight my mother is encouraging me to to seek out male\n",
      "attention and again this is a heterosexual Norm that they're facilitating and then the\n",
      "mixed messaging of I have to be feminine I have to be girly which is often\n",
      "associated with being crazy and too emotional so because of that I have to be masculine as well I have to masculine\n",
      "meaning I am not allowed to show emotion because then I'm weak so this constant\n",
      "back and forth and this beautiful quote of forcing women into one box that they\n",
      "have to sit in and they can't escape is a perversion it's a perversion of the Soul\n",
      "so in this state the participants really went into their\n",
      "childhood um and and how that created this this personality or this this\n",
      "understanding of identity where she became or she becomes this show\n",
      "of a person based on what Society needs from her based on what her parents need\n",
      "her to be to be the ex to to really become those external messages\n",
      "here's another quote when I was seven or eight years old my father said my biggest frustration is not having a son\n",
      "because a woman will never achieve what a man will achieve and this participant discussed this in all of the pain that\n",
      "this brought her and she she said in this moment she realized Not only was it\n",
      "shameful to be a woman but that she would she she used it as a motivation and that's something we see I see a lot\n",
      "I saw a lot in these interviews is that the the idea or the the suppression or the\n",
      "oppression of the self becomes this motivation of okay well I'm going to prove them wrong\n",
      "and I'm going to use that as my device to be able to survive\n",
      "and that's where we get the the shape shifting so the shape shifting is being able to kind of be a chameleon and\n",
      "manipulate situations based on what on survival\n",
      "so we have the Damsel in Distress which is the playing week playing as if okay I\n",
      "I need a man I need I need somebody who's better who's stronger than me to help me so I can get what I want and\n",
      "that comes into this like the idea of self-doubt of really uh really negating\n",
      "the idea of confidence and the ability to\n",
      "understand the self or become who she wants to become and then the unhealthy boundaries which\n",
      "are is related to that codependency and from all of that we get a limitation of\n",
      "an aspiration several participants mentioned that they're not even interested in continuing education or\n",
      "continuing their career because they know inherently that they will never be whatever they think they need to be in\n",
      "society or they will never have that power so here's a quote I rarely hear somebody\n",
      "describing a woman as feminine because there's this expectation that if you are a biologically or you identifies you\n",
      "know you must be inherently feminine and for this quote she's she's allowing the\n",
      "story of of how the the difference between feminine and\n",
      "woman and it was interesting in the in in the interviews because I asked that question what is the difference between\n",
      "feminine and women and and every single participant said there is a big difference they're different one is an\n",
      "energy one is a a physical way of being or an identity but then when I ask them\n",
      "okay what is the specific difference they were unable to parse them apart because there's this Association of\n",
      "traditional femininity with Womanhood so when she tries to survive or when she\n",
      "goes through this process she internalizes it so much that she fragments her personality and it becomes\n",
      "this distorted sense of self and a performance rather than a holistic idea\n",

      "sadness no anger no passion no Drive no ability to assert autonomy\n",
      "so when that yep 30 minutes got it no keep going when that\n",
      "seeps into the psyche there is this incredible Detachment from the idea of a\n",

      "this this ability to see oh these are nestled within the final themes of the\n",

      "the fact that this is a spectrum this isn't a just a b c linear type of\n",

      "way that continues to put the the feminine nature in this\n",
      "dichotomy of okay she was a goddess she was kicked out she was demonized and now\n",

      "was really missing a piece and that piece of being able to be messy and\n",
      "emotional needs to be there and the so because of because of that the\n",
      "other the other portion of this is is indoctrination so as women were telling\n",
      "me stories of their Early Childhood I became angry and I was very touched by a\n",
      "lot of these these these sexist stories uh and and then through time as they\n",
      "continued I started to realize oh their upbringing was actually trying to prepare them for the system it wasn't\n",
      "necessarily A abusive scenario it was more of a okay let's prepare you for the\n",
      "reality that you're about to meet and then uh that so that was so I and I\n",
      "transformed exponentially through this not only by confronting my own\n",
      "internalization of sexist beliefs and thoughts but also uh starting to to just\n",
      "starting to pull apart the ways that I am currently living my life that are under this\n",
      "I guess this uh this cloud or this Haze of being and how have I developed myself\n",
      "in that way and then the implications there are\n",
      "four that I'm laying out here so there's a self-help community of being able to engage with this framework on an\n",

      "bringing in more diversity and inclusion is very important to be able to create a\n",
      "sustainable theoretical framework so future research that builds upon mine\n",
      "and and takes those limitations and starts to fill that fill in the gap\n",
      "and then the spirituality aspect a lot of these participants were very engaged in their own alternative spiritual\n",
      "practice which brought them a lot of autonomy and and give gave them a\n",
      "capacity to deepen their understanding of their own identity outside of what has been put on them and then there's a\n",
      "potential of clinical practice so the hope is that both through one-on-one and\n",
      "in group practice this can be utilized as a way to better understand patience\n",
      "and be able to facilitate more transformation\n",
      "and these are my references I expect you to read every single one\n",
      "uh and that's it thank you\n",
      "Caitlin thank you so much that was an excellent presentation it was articulate\n",
      "and cogent and it really led us through your process and your thinking and really laid out the theoretical\n",
      "framework and the cycles of the perverse feminine so thank you so much I really enjoyed that and and I know you work\n",
      "very well so it was exciting to gain it gain new insights from this perspective\n",
      "thank you I'd love to open up to questions from the committee and I'd\n",
      "like to invite Dr Brianne Foss to start us off with some questions please\n",
      "oh yeah this is so great I just want to say again how polished and wonderful that presentation was and\n",
      "oh my gosh even your slides are just so beautiful anyway I just I love this project and I have to say it's you know\n",
      "I've been on many dissertations over the years and I rarely see anyone put as\n",
      "much of themselves in their work as this particular project did and it's just like so I just feel like it's very\n",
      "unique and I just want to like Mark that before I ask these questions because it's you know a lot of times I think\n",
      "when you're a PhD student you're sort of trained to be distant from your subject or to try to you know to to choose some\n",
      "Narrative of respectability or professionalism at the expense of having your you know you're being invested in\n",
      "your work and I think Kaelyn you did not fall into that trap at all and I really I think it the project really like\n",
      "thrives in part because you put so much of your of your own skin into it right it just really feels like\n",
      "it's made of your skin and I really appreciate that so I just wanted to say that first um yeah so I wanted gosh I have many\n",
      "questions but the one that really stands out to me just when I was listening to your presentation and thinking about\n",
      "this earlier today too is you know this kind of I'm interested in hearing you think about the relationship between\n",
      "healing and the sort of framework of social transformation Justice sort of\n",
      "anti-racism like you know fighting against patriarchy it feels like your participants are really also grappling\n",
      "with that a lot an awful lot and I wanted just for you to kind of think about how we see those things\n",
      "interfacing right because I feel like one of our tasks as clinicians is to kind of\n",
      "facilitate patients through the process of healing but also Justice frames and I\n",
      "think you know the perverse feminine really is like a nice Bridge there so I just like to hear you kind of think\n",
      "about that relationship because it feels really like it oozes from this work and from you and you know all these other\n",
      "parts of the project so yeah oh thank you thank you and I I love I\n",
      "love the love here it it it's so it's so wonderful so you were absolutely right\n",
      "and there's a there's a term I I explored today called what was it um\n",
      "now transformative societal transform is like now I'm forgetting it of course\n",
      "anyway in my belief and then also with the Union lens the collective and the\n",
      "individual are it's like a breathe and breathe out macro micro type of\n",
      "experience that within if if understanding how there was that idea of\n",
      "the overt sexism and the covert sexism and how these are two these two are playing a role with each other and how\n",
      "can the individual as they transform themselves begin to interact with the\n",
      "world differently begin to create a process where not only are they they\n",
      "quote unquote waking up to this Injustice that has been internalized but\n",
      "they're also starting to treat others differently show up differently hopefully start to create a container of\n",
      "Justice and and that is the from the psychological\n",
      "standpoint of as we start to shift our mindset we start to interact with the\n",
      "world differently uh and that is really my hope here and for me as I was as I\n",
      "was doing this research I'm just like patriarchy sexism oh my gosh these are\n",
      "so big and then what is my way in it's through the South it's through you can\n",
      "call it an eventuation or transformation or healing and and through that process I can start to bring more of myself into\n",
      "the societal change and the activism\n",
      "um does that answer the question I think that's a that's really good\n",
      "totally and I mean it really also makes me think of the way that we so often\n",
      "think about healing and Justice as somehow different like we are we we are\n",
      "a culture that divorces those two things and that also feels like a consequence\n",
      "of patriarchy to me and I so I'm also wondering what you think about that too like why is this not more of an\n",
      "intuitive link that we have and how like how and why do these Concepts seem to\n",
      "get divorced from each other you know whether it's on the ground doing therapy or even in research right like I'm I'm\n",
      "impressed with your methodologies that way too that you're really learning and growing from your participants and\n",
      "engaging with them in a sort of different methodological frame that a lot of times happens to but anyway\n",
      "healing and Justice feel like they need to be in conversation so I'm wondering why why they aren't and just if you\n",
      "could Riff on that a little and then I'll pass the Baton over over to your other committee members you're asking\n",
      "questions of the philosophical meaning of life\n",
      "what do we do uh no absolutely I mean\n",
      "for me it's so clear but it wasn't clear before it was clear if that makes sense\n",
      "so as I started engaging with my own psyche and with the jungian work I was\n",
      "stumbling upon this block that is very much what you're\n",
      "what you're talking about of how do I make how do I make use of of this work\n",
      "in the world through myself and and it is I I feel I mean well this is not\n",
      "research based this is my own opinion but but like I feel like it's much easier to compartmentalize things in\n",
      "life uh for me especially as if I'm just talking about my experiences like with\n",
      "trauma or the internalized oppression I a way to cope with that is to\n",
      "compartmentalize and we I kind of see that a little bit in the shape shifting uh stage of things of the need to say\n",
      "okay well I'm going to be the sexy woman here or I'm going to be the pure woman\n",
      "or I have to be this or it's like a constant negotiation of the self and\n",
      "there's also the in the spiritual Lane of of looking at the non-binary and the\n",
      "non-linear and that type of world and that's why I think the archetypes and the union framework\n",
      "held this so well because uh with that psychological theory we're looking at\n",
      "this ability to touch all of the pieces with that archetype so I can't answer\n",
      "the question fully and I think that's the point we don't we we don't know uh fully like\n",
      "they're they're there's much more research out there that I am not familiar with but that's why I'm doing\n",
      "this work is leaving it with that question of how how can we start to bridge that Gap and how can we start to\n",
      "create a world where we understand how they're so interconnected the healing\n",
      "and the societal work um and that's that's really my hope I didn't answer your question\n",
      "but I don't know if you needed a full no that was that was good that was great yeah\n",
      "love it thanks thanks for those questions\n",
      "this is Stefan we're gonna hand the Baton over to you for your questions okay thank you\n",
      "oh you can hear me okay yes\n",
      "um Caitlin I don't I don't have any questions I'm you know I just want to\n",
      "reflect that you know I'm in my position until very recently as the program\n",
      "manager for East West uh I was the usually the first person that people would come into contact with\n",
      "in the program so for the last five years I've been able to watch people kind of\n",
      "progress uh from where they where they were when they entered into the program\n",
      "many of them exiting the program some of them still in it working on their dissertations or or however long it\n",
      "takes them uh and I I just you know I I just want to say that I that I had a you know my\n",
      "particular experience of you has been really extraordinary I think that you're an extraordinary individual you came\n",
      "with vulnerability with authenticity into the program you were never shy to\n",
      "be exactly who you were no matter how much you struggle in the in the program uh you know looking for the kind of\n",
      "support that you felt that you needed sometimes not getting it or feeling that you weren't getting it\n",
      "and yet you were you know you're a Capricorn I know Capricorns because I am one you know we're goats and we just\n",
      "keep heading up that mountain we pick our path and we just keep going and with\n",
      "dogged determination you went from coming in rather green to turning yourself into an excellent scholar and\n",
      "academician and researcher this project was amazing but your presentation was\n",
      "extraordinary I just want to Echo what Brianne said it was beautiful\n",
      "to look at extraordinarily clear and I'm just I'm just really impressed I\n",
      "don't and I don't I don't have any questions about the project the questions that I had you got from me uh\n",
      "you know in kind of a huge download in the writing process\n",
      "um I guess I have a question I'm kind of curious what's what's next where do you\n",
      "take this next because you know one of the things that we learn you know in writing uh at an academic level\n",
      "especially at the student level is the Mantra of uh that's a very interesting question but I can't go into it here\n",
      "because there isn't enough space so I'm kind of curious where you take this and if I can just offer maybe one way to\n",
      "frame it you there was one point uh during your presentation where you said\n",
      "uh something like your your notion of what perversity was changed as a result of\n",
      "the interviews that for one individual it might be something completely different than for another individual can that be expanded so that this so\n",
      "that this notion of blowing up the binary can move even beyond your\n",
      "research in the Proverbs feminine and be applied into other areas of personality development and cultural and social\n",
      "issues I love that absolutely it's funny\n",
      "blowing up the the binary is a funny term because early on in this in this uh\n",
      "research I I did want to do just that and I was just like\n",
      "non-binary non-linear and then I had a discussion with debashish and he was and he's he\n",
      "was said well sometimes we need the categories or we need we need the the framework of understanding and because\n",
      "otherwise I was arguing myself out of having any words for anything uh and\n",
      "that that wouldn't work for research so what if we if we were to take this\n",
      "outside of this idea of perversity and we're just looking at this binary if we're the binary of I am hanging out if\n",
      "we have a spectrum of of whatever we want to call it a dog and\n",
      "a cat we have the Spectrum where do I sit on that Spectrum\n",
      "and and then just finding figuring out where do I sit am I am I a\n",
      "well my dog who wants to be a cat well how do I become a cat this is obviously\n",
      "not possible but but let's just play with the idea of how do I become a cat I'm going to move into the opposite end\n",
      "of the spectrum and I'm going to incorporate what I believe as and\n",
      "as completely different from myself and try that on and and become that and then\n",
      "can I then create a more holistic sense of being that is not just hanging out on\n",
      "one side of the binary and I'm I'm moving moving through this this idea of\n",
      "the dog and the cat and it's it's becoming a yeah I guess holistic is a good word for\n",
      "that and I believe Jung has a theory for that which is\n",
      "giving the mic to you the theory of of going into the opposite\n",
      "going into the opposite oh the oh and that is yes so I I am not too familiar\n",
      "with this however that is that is where I'm going with this idea of of going into that opposite way of being as a as\n",
      "a means to maybe not blow up the binary but start to dismantle it\n",
      "and then and then becoming in a space of the non-binary eventually but even saying the non-binary is creating a\n",
      "binary between the binary and the non-binary so so how do we get out of that frame of thinking I don't know and\n",
      "I think your question again it's like it's like what Brienne was saying of\n",
      "like well these are questions and these are this is the the point of research it's it's not to put a period at it at\n",
      "the at the end it's to put a question mark and to continue and to continue and Define the limitations and find the gaps\n",
      "and say okay my like for me my Buy has got in the way of this great now I know\n",
      "that data point and I'm going to work with it so so again these questions are\n",
      "big and they leave us with more questions yeah you know young kind of in his kind\n",
      "of structure or way of looking at things he said we're moving from the age of Pisces which is the age of the warring\n",
      "Brothers as he put it the two fish that are in Eternal conflict with one another that's the binary way of being\n",
      "to the Aquarian age where the individual the Aquarian individual is the one that carries that water\n",
      "the urn on their shoulder they're carrying their own Spirit within them they're becoming integrated\n",
      "and this this happens naturally over the course of time um but I I see work such as yours and\n",
      "and the work that many of the students at our school that are doing is kind of pushing into that into a new paradigm\n",
      "uh so I want to thank you because I really think that you've done excellent work I want to congratulate you thank\n",
      "you thank you um Caitlin I want to Echo both what\n",
      "briann and Stefan have said you know visually beautiful well Illustrated just\n",
      "engaging and excellent and well-paced so practice has paid off but you know I\n",
      "also want to Circle back to something you know we had engaged in a lot of\n",
      "early conversations around method and you know I really want to laud you\n",
      "because one of our conversations was around you know my you know holding\n",
      "this space and reminding and letting you know that intuitive inquiry is going to work you more than you are going to work\n",
      "the method and I just think you know you articulated it so clearly in your\n",
      "dissertation as well as in your presentation that one of my hopes is you write an article on using the method and\n",
      "the ways in which it can be used to you know expand and transform and I know\n",
      "Rosemary Anderson has written extensively around using intuitive inquiry is transformative but I think\n",
      "the way you approached embodied wrestled with\n",
      "got really mad at the process and I think you know as\n",
      "Brianne said the bringing the whole self and getting messy because there is this idea that somehow that\n",
      "um in the academy we should be above and we should have some sort of way of holding\n",
      "our work and what we do that's that isn't fully representative or isn't our\n",
      "you know part of our full self and I think and I hope that you know for all the participants who have been able to\n",
      "join us that this work has you know perhaps given you an aha moment in how\n",
      "to transformative peace but out of all of this I'm curious you know because and\n",
      "I think you touched upon this you know was there also a collective transformative piece for the\n",

      "works through you and that it worked through me and at one point I was and\n",
      "you know this because I came to you very frustrated and just like how am I\n",
      "supposed to find these things these themes are all interconnected what is happening and and\n",
      "I consulted with everyone in the committee actually around this and then finally was like no wait a second just\n",

      "most so so absolutely wrestling with with that process of of\n",
      "deconstructing my my self in a way because of that method it was and\n",
      "because it's in that hermeneutical spiral it gives you that structure and it's I think it's absolutely a brilliant\n",
      "way to to do research and start to to create in my dissertation I talked about\n",
      "how and there are several the the feminine or the women have been associated with\n",
      "this idea of intuition and emotion and then the academy is really focusing on the objective and the mind and and\n",
      "intuitive inquiry was important for this because it honored what has been traditionally\n",
      "uh constructed as a feminine quality which is obviously just\n",
      "not accurate but it but it allowed me to say I'm going to go into this and the\n",
      "way that that I that that is representing this feminist part of it\n",
      "um okay and then the second the question you have of the collective transformation\n",
      "absolutely through through that framework that I that I mapped out\n",
      "I was witnessing the transformation as it was occurring So Not only was this a narrative piece\n",
      "of them telling the story of their historical life and and the different parts of it and how they gained\n",
      "awareness here how they left the situation or how they they were treated as a child and and the ways that they\n",
      "they cope with life but in those stories was was this like through body language\n",
      "through the way that they shared themselves with me and even reporting at\n",
      "the end of it saying thank you thank you thank you I don't have I I've never had\n",
      "a space to have this conversation this is a like even there was a there was a woman who was in her 60s\n",
      "and she was every every response she had was I'm sorry or uh it was a lot of ums\n",
      "and a lot of I don't know like and I just I continuously reminded her that this is her space to share and at the\n",
      "end of it she was speaking without the ums she stopped apologizing and she\n",
      "stepped into her own self and her story and it was fascinating to watch and each\n",
      "participant had that type of Arc which is what finally validated this framework\n",
      "of oh wait a second I'm watching it in action uh and that is really at the root\n",
      "of the collective transformation that occurred I believe and it was it was for me\n",
      "personally to individually transform and the participant in trans they transform\n",
      "me in that way that I guess that's what I'm trying to say um\n",

      "just have one question yeah yeah go ahead\n",
      "um so my question I guess my question and again I've I've known you and and this\n",
      "like this kind of Journey we've we were we are accountability buddies in our PhD\n",
      "methods class and our research class and but it's it's just I think you're the topic is so rich and what you you bring\n",
      "to it it just continually opens opens uh Avenues in my mind aha moments and one\n",
      "thing that came out today that I was wondering about was\n",
      "um how like in terms of thinking about the future in terms of you know\n",
      "transformation healing social justice all of all these these\n",
      "aspects in which your your work is moving through and moving towards opening to a new future and I'm\n",
      "wondering how much that depends on getting behind the archetypal image\n",
      "because one of the ideas is that like even the The Mask\n",
      "why maybe maybe uh mute them yeah yeah so I\n",
      "was just I'm I'm just this is sort of I'm grappling with this and the idea of\n",
      "um even like blowing up the binary for instance and these ways in which like you address is it's not necessarily the\n",
      "answer but in terms of if we're caught in a Perpetual Recreation\n",
      "um with a different image but some kind of let's say uh dialectical kind of endless\n",
      "um you know um an endless type of cycle rather than a spiral for instance right so even if we if we redefine an\n",
      "archetypal image in a way that can strategic strategically help us move somewhere but are we still identifying\n",
      "with with an archetypal image or with an image of ourselves for instance that is kind of bound to replay out the the\n",
      "dialectic in a way or that kind of closure in on itself and so the one thing that I found myself gravitating\n",
      "towards was asking the question of um the relationship of the self it so\n",
      "Jung would have the idea of the archetype of the self and I think that this this is where I\n",
      "found the kind of a moving piece in your work because you are coming out of Jung for instance but then you're also\n",
      "bringing in post-structural and post-modern thinkers and so there would be a difference in my understanding in\n",
      "in the way in which the self is understood between these types of you know uh these types of uh thinking and\n",
      "so I just wanted you to maybe think a little like just like riff a little bit off of that in terms of how do you feel\n",
      "um that the self like the whether it's an archetype or Beyond like how is it\n",
      "that we need to engage in a self that can actually open to to this type of a a\n",
      "new type of a future so like what kind of a self or subjectivity do we need to leave behind what what type of what ways\n",
      "do we need to redefine even the notion of the self in order to move Beyond these problems you know\n",
      "and so that's sort of that's just maybe a big question but that was what was on my mind\n",
      "I knew you would bring you would you would question\n",
      "so to start with so Jung does hold the self Beyond so the\n",
      "archetype that that I'm working with here is within let's say if we're looking at\n",
      "Jung's model it's within that the collective unconscious is what holds\n",
      "the archetypes and then the perverse feminine would be in that Collective Shadow atmosphere\n",
      "and then if we look at Jung's model we're looking at the self as this this\n",
      "goal of intuition of individuation so the archetype with something would be\n",
      "something we work through so it'd be the shadow working through and it wouldn't be the end goal none of this is an end\n",
      "goal right it's it's all just this play or this flow with with with ourselves and and then and\n",
      "then as far as you're saying the post-structuralist post-modern post post uh how that's holding the self I mean\n",
      "you would have more experience with that and it's when when reading the feminist\n",
      "theorists around with that with that uh that lens it's more of this\n",
      "idea of hope like I keep using the word holistic\n",
      "because that feels right to to break away from like if we're looking at like\n",
      "Donna Donna haraway's work and how the cyborg is a creation of societal influences or\n",
      "we're looking at um the yeah so so we're looking at how that how\n",
      "the woman has been created based on society based on the collective norms and that is always the case\n",
      "that is always the case because there is this inner and outer experience of the collective and the individual so I think\n",
      "to to go into that question of boundaries or that question of binaries or dichotomies etc etc Spectrum\n",
      "there is always going to be a tie there but the question is does that tie\n",
      "necessarily mean that there is oppression or is there a potential for\n",
      "that tie or those bounds to not necessarily break out of them or become post-human in essence but but can we can\n",
      "we utilize those boundaries in order to cultivate this idea of what we're\n",
      "calling the self if we go into spirituality they would they would juxtapose it with the soul\n",
      "and and going into that Center space of holistic experience where it doesn't\n",
      "necessarily you use the word need I don't think there's there's a I think the\n",
      "if you if you were to say need it's that need to feel whole uh within any of these different\n",
      "articulations of the quote-unquote self so so how do we how do we journey in\n",
      "that space and and we can be in a boundary but that with having that boundary or that label Define us is what\n",
      "the where the issue comes in so I can decide I want to play this role I want to I want to be I want to play a role of\n",
      "this this particular version of me that's okay but I can do that but but I\n",
      "know that that is not ultimately me that is me playing this role and that is an expression of me but that is not this\n",
      "centerpiece of me and I'm not going to allow that to Define me or hold me or oppress me anymore I'm going to just\n",
      "play in that area I don't know if that answers your question but you always bring these\n",
      "questions of of meta understanding so so I hope that brings\n",
      "some kind of nuance to to to your love it yeah beautiful beautiful yeah you you\n",
      "definitely took it right into the that direction um that I felt like that I was\n",
      "I was leaning anyway in terms of how I'd grapple with that question but I love what you said and I also think a\n",
      "question I was I didn't don't have the time to ask but you did bring up shape-shifting so I think that what you\n",
      "said also addresses the idea of this this shape shifting is either it's out\n",
      "of the need to survive but shape shifting can also it also is\n",
      "necessary even like you're saying it doesn't need to be it can be a strategy to to deal with survival but it can also\n",
      "be a strategy to deal with transformation and and health in a different way so it's like you have different ways of\n",
      "approaching that idea of shape shifting as well which I think and to go with that you mentioned to address your your\n",
      "point about the archetypal image if you coming to that space of play\n",
      "understanding where the psyche is and the processes I can choose an image that\n",
      "is going to if if we look at what I was saying earlier of the spectrum of binaries of going to that dog and cat\n",
      "uh example if I want to I can play the archetypal image of the cat as a dog and\n",
      "maybe that's going to offer me a new experience or new transformation within\n",
      "myself but it doesn't mean I'm beholden to that it just means I I can so I think\n",
      "getting beyond the the let's say indoctrination part of it and\n",
      "understanding that we have this power to play is is really that that root of of\n",
      "what how I'm seeing the self beautiful beautiful\n",
      "thank you so much let's hand it back over to to Anne\n",
